# Automation Toolkit

Workflows and snippets I've built to automate repetitive tasks across UiPath and n8n. These are pulled from live projects, so they solve practical problems rather than demonstrating theory.

## What's Inside

**UiPath** – RPA workflows for desktop automation, data processing, and system integrations

**n8n** – API-based workflows for connecting tools, processing webhooks, and handling scheduled tasks

## Usage

These aren't polished packages. They're functional solutions you can adapt. Each folder has its own README with context on what the workflows do and any setup notes.

## Why This Exists

I got tired of rebuilding the same automations from scratch. If you're solving similar problems, feel free to use these as a starting point.
