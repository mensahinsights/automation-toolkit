# n8n Workflows

API integrations, webhook processors, and scheduled automations.

## What's Here

Workflows exported as JSON files from n8n. These handle tasks like connecting services, processing incoming data, and triggering actions based on events.

## Usage

Import the JSON files directly into your n8n instance (Workflows â†’ Import from File). You'll need to reconfigure any credentials or API keys since those aren't included in the export.

## Notes

These workflows assume certain node versions and integrations. Check your n8n setup if something doesn't work immediately. Most can be adapted by swapping out specific nodes while keeping the overall logic intact.
