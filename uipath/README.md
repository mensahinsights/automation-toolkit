# UiPath Workflows

RPA automations for desktop tasks, data processing, and Excel operations.

## What's Here

**datatable-operations/** – Adding columns, merging tables, removing duplicates, grouping data

**excel-automation/** – Formula insertion, column management, spreadsheet manipulation

**string-text-manipulation/** – Text parsing, regex operations, string formatting

**email-attachments/** – Saving attachments with date stamps, sending automated emails

**datetime-operations/** – Working day calculations, timezone conversions, date formatting

**utilities/** – Miscellaneous helpers and project templates

## Usage

These workflows were built in UiPath Studio. You'll need UiPath installed to open and run them. Most are standalone and can be dropped into your own projects.

Dependencies and framework versions are specified in each workflow's `project.json` file.

## Notes

Not all workflows are heavily commented; these are reference snippets I've used  along the way or thought I might need at some point. The folder names and activity sequences should give enough context to understand what's happening. Adapt as needed for your use case.
